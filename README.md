# Café Ordering System
 
Welcome to the Café Ordering System project!
This project was developed by Cherish Vasant as an 11th-grade school project. 
The project is written in Java and aims to provide a simple command-line interface for ordering beverages and food items from a café.

#### Features: 

_User Registration:_ Users can enter their name and other details to access the ordering system.

_Menu Display:_ Users can view the café's menu, including various categories of beverages, food items, and their corresponding prices.

_Order Placement:_ Users can order items by selecting them from the menu and specifying the quantity. 

_Bill:_ After ordering all items, a bill is displayed, including the items ordered and the total cost.


If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue in the repository.
