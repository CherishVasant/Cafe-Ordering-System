# Café Ordering System
 
Welcome to the Café Ordering System project!
This project was developed by Cherish Vasant as an 11th-grade school project. 
The project is written in Java and aims to provide a simple command-line interface for ordering beverages and food items from a café.

Features:

User Registration: Users can enter their name and other details to access the ordering system.

Menu Display: Users can view the café's menu, including various categories of beverages, food items, and their corresponding prices.

Order Placement: Users can order items by selecting them from the menu and specifying the quantity. 

Bill: After ordering all items, a bill is displayed, including the items ordered and the total cost.


If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue in the repository. 
Thank you for checking out the Café Ordering System project!
